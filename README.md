## School Management System

The School Management System is a way for me to get used to working with both Python and MySQL. The project will use Python and MySQL to mimic a school login system. Users will be able to login as professors, students or an admin. Each of the account types will have its own unique features (See below).

## Features

* Admin login and commands (Admins can register/delete teacher and student accounts)✔️
* Student login ✔️
* Professor login ✔️
* Attendance System (Professors will be able to mark students L/A/P (late/absent/present) and students will be able to download them into text files) ✔️
* Adding courses to an account (Students will be able to enroll/unenroll in courses) ✔️
